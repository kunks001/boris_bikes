This repo contains my response to a challenge set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen and Alex Peattie during week three of Makers Academy

Task
----

* Design a program that mimics the boris bikes system in London:
	- bike stations will contain bikes
	- people can rent/return bikes from/to bike stations
	- bikes can be broken
	- vans will collect broken bikes from bike stations and return them to the garage where they'll be fixed
	- vans will collect fixed bikes from the garage and return them to bike stations
